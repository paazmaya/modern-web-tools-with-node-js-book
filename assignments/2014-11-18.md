# Fourth assignment

> Given in 18th Nov 2014, to be returned by 9th Dec 2014

Extend your existing project which was originally started in [the first assignment](2014-09-16.md),
continued in [the second](2014-10-07.md) and [the third](2014-10-28.md) assignments.

The goal is to have a release `1.0.0` shape once this fourth assignment is done.
