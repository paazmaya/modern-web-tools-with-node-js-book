Extend your existing project which was started in [the first assignment](2014-09-16.md)
and continued further in [the second assignment](2014-10-07.md).

Use the automated tests done in the second assignment and add code coverage testing on them.
Push the results to [Coveralls.io][] and display the results in your projects `README.md`.

Once the tests and coverage results appear, increase the test coverage percentage by adding unit tests to your project.

This assignment is evaluated by a successful installation of [Coveralls.io][] service to the given project.
The history shown at [Coveralls.io][] for the project should show an increase in the test coverage percentage.
