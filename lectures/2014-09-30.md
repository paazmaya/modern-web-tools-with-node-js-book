> Date 30/09/2014


## Unit testing in general

Unit testing, as the name suggests, is a way of testing units or portions of code.

## Popular unit testing frameworks

* [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/ "Behavior-Driven JavaScript")
* [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/ "Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on node.js and the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun")
* [Qunit](http://qunitjs.com/ "QUnit is a powerful, easy-to-use JavaScript unit testing framework")
* [nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit "Easy unit testing in node.js and the browser, based on the assert module")


## PhantomJS, a headless WebKit browser

In an environment where there is no availability of screens, such as a server,
continuous integration server specifically, is a need for tools which do not require the screen.
One such tool specifically made for browser based testing, is [PhantomJS][].

However the latest release of PhantomJS, 1.9.7 from January 2014, is based on a [WebKit][] from 2011.
The next major release should be out soon and it will be based on a much newer [WebKit][], via Qt 5.3.

[PhantomJS]: http://phantomjs.org/ "PhantomJS is a headless WebKit scriptable with a JavaScript API"
[WebKit]: http://www.webkit.org/ "WebKit is an open source web browser engine"
[Qt]: http://qt-project.org/ "Qt is a cross-platform application and UI framework for developers using C++ or QML, a CSS & JavaScript like language"
