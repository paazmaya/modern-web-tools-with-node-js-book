# Lecture 2. - Github forks and pull requests

> Date 02/09/2014


Tasks that are done during this lecture:

1. Create local repository, `git init`
    - Add files to it, `git add`
    - Commit those files with a meaningful message, `git commit -m`
2. Create an empty repository at Github
    - Add that as a remote for the repository made in task 1.
    - Push your local repository to Github, making it public, `git push`
3. Create new repository at Github, with predefined files
    - Clone the repository, `git clone`
    - Make changes and push them
4. Tag the latest commit of the repository made in 3. with [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) number, `git tag`
    - Add release notes to it in Github, thus making it a release
5. Create a fork from a repository of the student sitting next to you, that was created in 3.
    - Make few changes to the `README.md` and push
    - Create a Pull Request
6. Make changes to your own repository, which the other has forked
7. Update the fork created in 5., `git fetch`, `git merge`

Now that you are familiar with Git, Github and forking, feel free to fork this repository and create a pull request that would add your presentation subject and date #11.
