# Lecture 12. - More about unit testing and code coverage

> Date 11/11/2014

Continuing with unit tests and code coverage as they are crucial parts for making any given project trustworthy and  prone against regressions.

## Tasks for the day

1.  Find a project that some what small and might even have initial unit test done with `nodeunit`, but other unit testing frameworks are fine too
	- It could be the one you used in [task 2 of an earlier leture](2014-10-14.md)
	- Extend those unit test or add them, to cover more methods of that module
2. Add code coverage check
3. Push coverage results to coveralls.io
4. Do the optional (third) task from [an earlier lecture](2014-10-28.md)
