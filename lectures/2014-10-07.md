# Lecture 7. - Unit testing, Jasmine, PhantomJS

> Date 07/10/2014

[Second assignment is given.](../assignments/2014-10-07.md)


## Unit testing in general

Unit testing, as the name suggests, is a way of testing units or portions of code.

## Popular unit testing frameworks

* [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/ "Behavior-Driven JavaScript")
* [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/ "Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on node.js and the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun")
* [Qunit](http://qunitjs.com/ "QUnit is a powerful, easy-to-use JavaScript unit testing framework")
* [nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit "Easy unit testing in node.js and the browser, based on the assert module")


## PhantomJS, a headless WebKit browser

In an environment where there is no availability of screens, such as a server,
continuous integration server specifically, is a need for tools which do not require the screen.
One such tool specifically made for browser based testing, is [PhantomJS][].

However the latest release of PhantomJS, 1.9.7 from January 2014, is based on a [WebKit][] from 2011.
The next major release (`2.0.0`) should be out soon and it will be based on a much newer [WebKit][], via [Qt][] 5.3.


## Tasks for the day

1. Add unit tests to your `hello-node-js` repository by using `nodeunit`
  - Unit test spec files are placed in a directory called `tests`
  - Each unit test file named as its targeting source file and `_spec.js` suffix
2. Add a task runner task for running the unit tests
  - Make sure that tests can be run after a fresh clone of the repository,
    followed by `npm i` and `[task runner] test`, for example `grunt test`
