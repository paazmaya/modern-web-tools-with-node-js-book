> Date 10/07/2014

[Second assignment is given.](../assignments/2014-10-07.md)

Developers often need to do repetitive manual work which could be automated.

## Task for the day

Create a pull request at Github to someone else's repository, for example a classmate, which adds:
- Add a task runner
- Linting via task runnet, configured for all JavaScript files
- Unit tests via task runner, if there are no tests available, create placeholders

The task is evaluated with the following points in mind:

* Fork and pull request are done to the latest development code
* Positive attitude in public comments and messages
* Possible contribution guidelines are followed
* Pull request adds value to the targeted repository


* [Broccoli](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli "Browser compilation library – a build tool for applications that run in the browser")
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/ "The JavaScript Task Runner")
* [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/ "The streaming build system")
